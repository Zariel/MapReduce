For much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest on pole position
Grids were generally limited to 26 cars - if the race had more entries qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race
During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session
The qualifying format began to change in the late 1990s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap

The current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season
Known as "knock-out" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2 and Q3
In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being "knocked out" at the end of the period and their grid positions set, based on their best lap times
Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period
After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts
Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed, and will count toward that driver's placement
The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.[46] Currently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers
During this period, any driver whose best lap time exceeds 107% of the fastest time, will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards
In Q2, the fifteen remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the 10 fastest times and proceed to the next period
Finally, Q3 sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first 10 grid positions.[46] Drivers may run any tyre compound throughout the qualifying session, and each car taking part in the final period receives an extra set of the 'option' (softer) tyre
All drivers must start the race on the tyre used Q2, unless the weather requires the use of wet-weather tyres.[47] Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying
Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component
If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying, but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid.
